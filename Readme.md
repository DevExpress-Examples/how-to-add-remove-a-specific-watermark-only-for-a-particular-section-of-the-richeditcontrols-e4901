<p>This example extends the approach demonstrated in the following example: <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E4184">How to add a watermark with a text or image to the document</a></p><p>The main idea of the approach demonstrated in this sample is to add/remove a watermark only for a currently selected section.</p><p>For this purpose, two items were added to the RichEditControl's context menu:</p><p>- "Add watermark". This item click results in opening a file dialog to select an image. This image will be inserted as a watermark for a currently selected section.</p><p>- "Remove watermark". This item click results in deleting the watermark only from the currently selected section.</p>
